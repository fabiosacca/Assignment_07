Documents for Assignment_07 - Foundations of Programming (Python) - Aut'22

In this project I include my Python script and Knowledge Document part of the <b>Assignment n.7 for the Foundation of Programming course</b> with the University of Washington (Autumn, 2022). In this assignment, I have covered the steps needed to modify a program 'CD Inventory' that I created in past weeks in order to:
<li> Address areas of improvement from last week;
<li> Modify the permanent data store to use binary data;
<li> Add structured error handling where needed.

Thanks for reviewing this project. Any feedback and suggestions to improve the program are appreciated!
